## An empirical test of the Fama-French three-factor model in the Chinese stock market
- A code implementation of event study method and factor analysis
- Programming using Python and Stata
- **Abstract**：This article uses transaction data from China's A-share market from 2000 to 2019 to conduct an empirical study on the capital asset pricing model. First, we analyzed the Fama-French three-factor model, which comprehensively uses market factors, size factors, and value factors for capital asset pricing. The results show that it can capture most of the changes in the A-share market returns, and it has a good impact on the constructed 25 The adjusted R^2 of each portfolio regression is greater than 0.88. Secondly, this article considers the "shell value pollution" problem caused by the unique IPO regulation of the Chinese stock market and minimizes its impact by removing the stocks with the lowest 30% of market capitalization. This allows some abnormal results in the three-factor model to be effectively corrected. Finally, we provide our own insights into the insufficient validity of the three-factor model in the Chinese stock market and the areas that need improvement. This article is unique in data selection. It provides a screening plan for A-share stock data and presents the data processing and regression analysis process in detail.

## A Chinese interest rate ceiling, floor and double limit contract
- with pricing analysis using standard market models
- **Project Introduction**: By designing interest rate upper limit, lower limit and double limit contracts, stipulating maturity period, limited interest rate, principal and other variables, China's zero-coupon treasury bond spot interest rate is used to calculate the forward interest rate, and then the fluctuation of the forward interest rate is measured through historical data. rate, substitute each variable into the model, and price the interest rate unit. If the price of the interest rate unit on each interest rate reset date is known, the price of an interest rate contract can be found by accumulation.
